# MetaWear C++ API #
This project is a C++ implementation of the MetaWear protocol.  If compiled as a shared library, it can be used with any language that supports calling C functions from a shared library, such as C# and Python.  The library only constructs the bytes for communicating with the MetaWear platform, it **does not** contain any Bluetooth LE code.  Users will need to fill in the appropriate Bluetooth LE functions for their target device.

# Build #
Building the project has been tested on \*nix systems with GCC 4.8.5 and Clang 3.7.0, and on Windows with Visual Studio Community 2015.  

```sh
> gcc --version
gcc (SUSE Linux) 4.8.5

> clang++ --version
clang version 3.7.0 (tags/RELEASE_370/final 246586)
Target: x86_64-suse-linux
Thread model: posix
```

## GCC and Clang ##
Linux users can build the project by invoking GNU make.  The default action is to build the shared library for your platform.

```sh
> make
```

You can change the C++ compiler by overriding the CXX make variable.
```sh
> make CXX=clang++
```

Upon a successful compile, the library will be placed in the newly created "dist" directory.

```sh
> tree dist
dist/
└── release
    └── lib
        └── x64
            ├── libmetawear.so -> libmetawear.so.0
            ├── libmetawear.so.0 -> libmetawear.so.0.5.0
            └── libmetawear.so.0.5.0

```

## Visual Studio ##
Compiling the code in Visual Studio only requires a few changes to the project properties:

1. Add the path to the MetaWear source in the **Include Directories** file
2. Disable the **Precompiled Headers** compile option  
3. Add **METAWEAR_DLL_EXPORTS** to the preprocessor list

# Testing #
Unit tests for the library are written in Python (min v3.4.1) and can be invoked by calling the test target.

```sh
> make test
python3 -m unittest discover -s test
